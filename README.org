#+title: Rajiko
* About
Listen to [[https://radiko.jp/][rajiko]] outside Japan (based on [[https://github.com/jackyzy823/rajiko][jackyzy823/rajiko]] project),
with radio list and download functions (based on [[https://github.com/uru2/radish][uru2/radish]] project).

This is rewritten in Common Lisp, aiming to provide a simple
interface for rajiko (since I don't use Chrome and not familiar
to Japanese Katakana UI yet).

Currently is (almost) done, but with a buggy and unstable interface,
also, plenty hidden bugs. But I think it is some kind usable.

If you just want to use it, download it and place it to where your
ASDF system could found, and use SBCL to load it:

#+begin_src shell
  sbcl --eval "(ql:quickload 'rajiko)" \
       --eval "(rajiko.ui::rajiko-cli)" \
       --eval "(quit)"
#+end_src

Or you could compile it like this on SBCL:

#+begin_src shell
  sbcl --eval "(ql:quickload :rajiko)" \
       --eval "(sb-ext:save-lisp-and-die \"rajiko\" :compression t :executable t :toplevel #'rajiko:rajiko-cli)"
#+end_src

Having fun.
